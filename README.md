# Order_Processing_System

here is an overview of an order processing system that has three members: PlantHead, Client, and Admin:

PlantHead: The PlantHead is responsible for managing the order processing system and they can also view the status of all orders.
Client: The Client is the person or organization that places an order. They can view the status of their order, and they can also contact the PlantHead if they have any questions or concerns.
Admin: The Admin is responsible for maintaining the order processing system. They can add or remove PlantHead, and they can also make changes to the system's settings.
The order processing system would typically work as follows:

The Client places an order through the system.
The order is routed to the PlantHead for approval.
The PlantHead fulfills the order and ships it to the Client.
The system would also allow the Client to track the status of their order. They could see when the order was placed.
